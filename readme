created 3 main components 
Header : include logo

filtered items to display filtered items and clear button:
filtered items come from all selected items, if we click x to remove item will connect to category title => number of selected items .
and we can clear all items.

Main component for Menu :
that includes dropdown component which includes the dropdown button and the container of items with apply and cancel button .
and add the mobile changing style when resize the window to 500px.

I used redux and redux toolkit to create slice which handle the selected items state.


Note:
I will explain every single line once requested.
